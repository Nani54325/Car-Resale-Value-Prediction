# Car-Resale-Value-Prediction


### Abstract
The main purpose of this project is to predict the car price by using different regression algorithms. In our daily process at some time if we want to buy a car in a second hand for learning purpose this is one of the way to predict the price for the car by using different algorithms. In this project the algorithms we are using to predict the values are support vector regression algorithm, random forest regression algorithm. So, as we are using different algorithms, in practical terms they have their advantages and disadvantages. So by implementing the algorithms the prediction values will be shown in graph format and we will find the accuracy rate of the algorithms so by using these accuracy rate we can find out which algorithm is best among all for prediction.
We will conclude with our final outcome that is to predict the car resale values and the which algorithm is best for prediction of car resale value. Hence we will use random forest regression algorithm and support vector regression algorithm to get the accurate price of the resale cars. These algorithms are machine learning based algorithms.
